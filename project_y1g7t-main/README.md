# My Personal Project: NBA trade simulator

## My CPSC 210 personal project will be a java-based NBA trade simulator with a graphic interface
### Enter NBA players' name(s) and salary(s) inside two teams and see  if the trade works.
### Possible features include visualizing the players and team's logo

**Phase0 task2**:

- What will the application do?: My application will be an NBA player trade simulator
that will include real players from the 2021-2022 season and will tell users if one trade
is possible or not based on the salary of the players.
- Who will use it?: Mainly for NBA fans or sport analytic who are trying to build their 
own team
- Why is this project of interest to you?: Since myself is a big NBA fan and there are plenty
theoretical trade scenarios that aren't possible according to the rules of NBA, this app will be perfect 
to test the cases.

# Phase 4: Task 3

- I went into every class I created in my program and drew the UML diagram according to the rules.
- What I expect to refactor some functions like 1. choosing the player's team from a dropdown menu
- and 2. writing more exceptions so my program would not crash so easily.
